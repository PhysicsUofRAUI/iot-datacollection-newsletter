# iot-datacollection-newsletter
This repository is meant to hold references and pdf links, if they exist, to papers that describe how IoT devices are being used to collect all kinds of data.

# Orgainization
I intend to orgainize the folders by month and year. So the first folder will be 2021/April, since this repo was started April 2021. Within each folder a markdown files with in the format paper-title.md will exist for each paper from that month, and in that file a reference (possibly pdf link) as well as a short paragraph describing how it relates to IoT and data collection. In the paragraph an explanation of how it is important and what good may come from the accomplishments described should also exist.

Eventually a markdown template will be created and articles may be orgainized by categories such as Health, Agriculture, Energy, etc.
