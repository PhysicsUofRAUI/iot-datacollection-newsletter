# Overview
A NB-IoT enabled device was conected to a flow meter to monitor the amount of water that goes through a filtration system. With the knowledge of how much water has gone through the system maintainers of the system know when the filters have to be changed without having to go check the filters. Target area was school drinking fountains in China and it has been deployed in 39 schools which consist of a total of 326 IoT meters at the time of the paper (December 2019). The Hyperledge fabric was used to secure and verify the string of data.

A bluetooth tag system was also implemented to keep track of disinfection schedule.
