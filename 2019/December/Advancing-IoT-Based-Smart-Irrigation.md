# Description
The article discusses the [Swamp Project's](http://swamp-project.org/) system for smart irrigation. The moisture sensors detect the moisture level in the soil and then outside weather reports are accessed and integrated with the moisture data to output what is hoped to be an optimal irrigation amount. All this data is available to the farmer via an app the Swamp Project created for that purpose.
