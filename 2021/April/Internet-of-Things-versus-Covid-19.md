# Overview
In this paper a low cost prototype of a system to monitor heat rate and oximetry data of people going about their day to day lives is presented. Data from three different patients are also presented. The authors suggest that this type of system could be used by municipalities to monitor the health of thier population, and in particular to contain Covid-19. 

My main takeaways is how convenient it would be for the patient to have this sensor on them all day. The Arduino Uno would be too heavy and cumbersome, but I am not sure whether the ESP32 controller is better or not since I have not used it before. I do like seeing projects like these since I believe that IoT devices have enormous potential in aiding health workers by detecting diseases much earlier than diseases are detected today.
